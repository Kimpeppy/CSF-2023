Contributions: 

For the second milestone, Afaf implemented the code for error handling in main.cpp and for storing values of The arguments for 
memory access trace read from standard input. Using these values, she calculated the index, offset, and tag of the input address 
to compare with the cache address. Michael implemented all the functions in csimfuncs.cpp and wrote the code for applying the 
conditional logic for the cache simulation in main.cpp (i.e., calculating hits and misses for each cache configuration).
