TODO: add information about contributions of team member(s)

Group members: Michael Kim, Afaf Saqib Qureshi

Contributions: 

The functions for the first milestone were implemented by Michael because after seeing how the functions were to be implemented, 
it was decided that since it required minimal coding, it could be completed by just one of the group members.

For the second milestone, independent contributions included Michael implementing the uint256_add and uint256_sub functions 
while Afaf implemented the uint256_create_from_hex function. For the uint256_mul function, both group members collaborated 
together for its implementation. Most coding for this function was done together where the steps for the implementation were 
discussed between both partners and one person would act as the scribe (so as to share the same screen).
Debugging was also done the same way for the most part.
